1. OpenAuth / Serverless Auth Layer

Language: TypeScript (recommended) or JavaScript

Why: Cloudflare Workers fully supports JS/TS, and TypeScript gives type safety for multi-tenant logic.

Libraries:

openid-client for OIDC

passport-saml for SAML integration

jsonwebtoken for JWT handling

2. Database / KV Layer

D1 (PostgreSQL-compatible): standard SQL syntax, can be queried from JS/TS

KV Store: accessed via Workers API in JS/TS

3. Admin Portal / Dashboard

Frontend Language: TypeScript (React, Vue, or Svelte)

Why: Strong typing + large ecosystem for building dynamic admin interfaces

CSS / UI: Tailwind, Chakra UI, or similar

4. App Integration Layer

Internal apps can be written in any language that supports OAuth2/OIDC:

Node.js / TypeScript

Python (Flask/Django)

Java (Spring Security)

.NET (ASP.NET Core)

PHP (Laravel)

They just need to validate JWTs from OpenAuth

5. Automation Scripts

Language: Node.js / TypeScript

Tasks: provisioning orgs/users, syncing IdP metadata, license checks

✅ Summary

Core Language: TypeScript (for Cloudflare Workers + Admin Portal)

Optional / Client Languages: depends on your internal apps (Node.js, Python, Java, .NET, PHP, etc.)

Why TypeScript: safety, scalability, and seamless integration with Workers and modern web frontend frameworks.



Step 1: Updated Architecture Overview
Core Components

OpenAuth Server (Cloudflare Workers)

OAuth2/OpenID Connect provider

Manages tokens for all internal/external apps

Multi-tenant aware (handles multiple orgs)

Multi-Tenant Directory Layer

Organizations Table: org info, domains, admin accounts, subscription

Users Table: email, roles, password/federated id, org ID

Tenant-Apps Table: which orgs have access to which apps

SSO Federation Layer

Supports:

Azure AD, Google Workspace, Okta via SAML/OIDC

Internal domains for your own apps

Maps external identities to your internal user records

Internal App Integration Layer

Each of your 11 internal apps is registered with OpenAuth

OAuth2/OpenID Connect endpoints

Shared session via JWTs

Role-based access control per app

Organization Admin Portal

Manage:

Users

Roles & permissions

App access

SSO connection settings

Licensing & billing

Billing / Licensing System

Stripe or Paddle integration

Enforce license limits per org/user count

Observability & Security

Login audits (internal + external)

MFA (optional)

Rate limiting & anomaly detection

Encryption at rest & in transit

Step 2: Multi-Domain / Multi-App Design

You have 11 internal domains, so you need domain-aware routing and SSO:

Domain Table

domain_name (e.g., app1.yourcorp.com)

app_id (internal app mapping)

org_id (optional if the domain is tied to external org)

SSO_type (OpenAuth / SAML / OIDC)

Token Flow

Users login once via OpenAuth

JWT includes:

user_id, org_id, roles, allowed_apps

JWT accepted by all internal apps across domains

Internal App Login

Apps redirect to /authorize endpoint

Token validation via JWKS or introspection endpoint

Supports SSO across all 11 domains

Step 3: Enterprise Org Onboarding & User Management

Sign-up Flow

Org admin registers org and domain(s)

Admin account created

Payment processed and subscription activated

Invite / Provision Users

Admin invites users by email

Auto-mapping to organization based on email domain

Optionally, federated login with their IdP (Azure AD/Okta)

User Access Assignment

Admin assigns which apps users can access

Admin can define roles (Admin / Power User / Viewer)

Optional per-app feature toggles

Federated SSO Integration

Admin connects IdP to your platform:

SAML metadata / OIDC discovery

SCIM for provisioning (if supported)

Users authenticate via corporate IdP

First-time login auto-provisions user in your system

Step 4: Internal + External App Federation Flow
[User Access App X] 
        ↓
[Redirect to OpenAuth /authorize] 
        ↓
[Check Org + Domain]
        ↓
[Local login OR SSO federation]
        ↓
[Generate JWT with allowed apps & roles]
        ↓
[Redirect back to App X with token]
        ↓
[App X validates token, grants access]


This flow is identical for all 11 internal apps and any SaaS apps

JWT ensures single login across domains

Supports internal users and external enterprise orgs

Step 5: Licensing & Billing Automation

Assign each org a subscription tier:

e.g., $100/org/month

$10/user/month add-ons

Auto-limit:

Number of users per subscription

Number of apps enabled

Trigger warnings:

When org is near license limits

If payment fails, disable new user creation

Auto-renew via Stripe/Paddle APIs

Display usage dashboard for org admins

Step 6: Security & Compliance Automation

MFA enforcement: optional per org

Audit logs: all login events, admin actions, SSO events

Brute force protection: per domain / IP throttling

Token security: JWT signed with rotating key, short-lived access + refresh tokens

Data privacy:

Each tenant’s data isolated

Encryption at rest and in transit

Compliance-ready for GDPR/HIPAA if needed

Step 7: Deployment / Automation Strategy

Cloudflare Workers

Deploy OpenAuth server functions

KV for sessions

D1 for relational multi-tenant database

CI/CD Automation

GitHub Actions → build → deploy

Auto-run database migrations on new features

Environment variables (IdP secrets, JWT keys) injected securely

Observability

Worker analytics: requests, latency

D1/KV usage

Alerts on errors or failed logins

Auto-Provisioning

Scripts for:

Org creation

User creation

App assignment

IdP metadata updates

Step 8: Future Enhancements

Per-App Role Mapping for internal apps

SCIM auto-provisioning for large orgs

Custom branding / login pages per org

Webhook support to notify apps of user changes

Advanced analytics: usage stats, login patterns

Self-service SSO federation for enterprise orgs

Step 9: Visual High-Level Flow (Expanded)
[Org Admin Signup] 
       ↓
[Verify Domain / Payment] 
       ↓
[Admin Account Created] 
       ↓
[Invite Users / Configure Apps] 
       ↓
[Users Login] -> [OpenAuth Server]
                     ↓
          ┌───────────┴─────────────┐
   [Local Auth]                 [SSO Federation]
   (Internal users)             (External orgs via IdP)
          ↓                           ↓
[JWT issued with org + app access + roles]
                     ↓
    ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
[Internal App 1..11 across domains] [External SaaS Apps]


💡 Key Points

You’re effectively building your own Okta/Auth0 style SaaS with multi-tenant SSO.

Internal apps across 11 domains are supported via JWT + domain-aware auth.

External orgs can onboard themselves and connect via federated SSO.

Admin portal + automated licensing makes this monetizable.

Cloudflare Workers + D1/KV gives you serverless scalability without managing traditional backend servers.
